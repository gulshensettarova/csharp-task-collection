# CSharp Collection – University Tasks Repository

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a structured collection of alternative C# task examples designed for university students. The main purpose of this repository is to provide additional and alternative examples related to the task topics given to students, helping them better understand the subjects covered in class. The examples span from basic C# concepts to advanced topics, including Windows Forms, Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, Algorithms, and Database integration, and can be used as reference materials alongside coursework.

The tasks are divided into **modules**, and each module focuses on a specific topic area.
